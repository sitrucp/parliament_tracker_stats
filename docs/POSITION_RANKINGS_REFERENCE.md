## Notes on Committee Roles

Committee roles are matched from the `committees.role_name` field:
- **Chair** (30 pts): Leads committee, sets agenda, manages debates
- **Vice-Chair** (20 pts): Supports chair, substitutes when needed
- **Co-Chair** (10 pts): Shares chairing responsibilities (less common)
- **Member** (0 pts): Regular committee participation (baseline expectation)

All MPs are expected to serve on at least one committee, so regular "Member" status receives no leadership score.

---

## Scoring Formula

```javascript
position_leadership_score = (weighted_average × 0.70) + (peak_rank × 0.30)

where:
  weighted_average = Σ(rank_value × months_held) / total_months_in_parliament
  peak_rank = highest rank ever held
```

**Example**: 
- PM for 48 months (100 pts), Minister for 24 months (70 pts), MP for 48 months (0 pts)
- Total tenure: 120 months
- Weighted avg: [(100×48) + (70×24) + (0×48)] / 120 = 54.0
- Peak: 100
- **Score**: (54.0 × 0.70) + (100 × 0.30) = **67.8**
